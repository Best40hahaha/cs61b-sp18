All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: resize, to double the size is really amazing, originally, I just add one/ten naively.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: (1) add lots of vars to avoid magic numbers in the methods; (2) create a new calculation way uniquely for the list.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: to deal with the index part, I divid them into 2 parts and do copy & paste work

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: to deal with the index part

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: nothing actually

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: the pointer part / recursive way 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: do several methods in recursive way

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: some pointer treatment is tedious

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: more pointer practice

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: cleaner treatment for the pointer part

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: yes
